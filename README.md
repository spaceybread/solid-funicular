[newbody.py](https://github.com/spaceybread/solid-funicular/blob/main/newbody.py) is based on [the ThreeBodyBot Numeric Tutorial](https://github.com/kirklong/ThreeBodyBot/blob/master/NumericsTutorial/NumericalDynamicsTutorial.ipynb)

[3body.py](https://github.com/spaceybread/solid-funicular/blob/main/3body.py) is a work in progress attempt at doing it through an object-oriented implementation

[config.py](https://github.com/spaceybread/solid-funicular/blob/main/config.py) has object mass, position, and velocities for the simulation; you can add your by following the template and commenting out/removing the unnecessary ones
